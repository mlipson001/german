                    <h1>Challenges</h1>
                    <p>Just because the German and English languages have common roots it does not mean that it will be easy for the average English-speaking person to become fluent in German.</p>
                    <p>Mark Twain famously noted the difficulty in learning German in Appendix D of the 1880 book <span class="italics">The Tramp Abroad</span> &nbsp; titled "The Awful German Language."</p>
                    <div class="center">
                        <img class="aligntop inline-block pictborder" src="images/MarkTwain.LOCtn.jpg">

                        <p class="triangle-isosceles italics">"A person who has not studied German can form no idea of what a perplexing language it is.  Surely there is not another language that is so slip-shod and systemless, and so slippery and elusive to the grasp."</p>

                    <div class="clearfix block"></div>
                    <p>One cause of confusion for people used to speaking English is that German nouns have one of three genders: masculine, feminine and neuter.  With a few exceptions grammatical gender does not tie to physical gender.  Although Old English had grammatical genders, Modern English does not.  Even words that have pseudo-genders in English have them because of their perceived gender.  For example,  the word motherland and the perception that ships are feminine (as in "She is a beautiful ship").  It has been noted that grammatical genders may affect the perception of the inanimate objects.  For example bridges are more likely to be described as beautiful in languages where the word is grammatically feminine and strong and powerful in languages  where the word is grammatically masculine. </p>
                    <p>There is typically no way to know the grammatical gender of a word so it must be learned with the vocabulary being memorized.  For example,  der Wagen  and das Auto both translate to car in English but der Wagen is masculine and das Auto is neuter. The word articles der, das and die show the gender of the word.   Even physical gender does not guarantee the knowledge of grammatical gender.  For example although the words man, woman and boy match their physical gender,  the grammatical gender of das M&auml;dchen, girl, is neuter.  It has been suggested that this may be because girl in German could have been derived from the diminutive form of a word that is no longer used in German (i.e. maid and maiden).  The diminutive form of words in German area always neuter. For example der Hund, dog in German,  is grammatically masculine but das Hundchen, doggy in German,  is grammatically neuter.  In addition,  all plural words take the plural article,  die (i.e. die M&auml;nner: the men).</p> 
                    <p>Although German has the same base alphabet as English, the letters can be pronounced differently and there are an additional four letters.  Three of the additional letters are vowels with umlauts, &auml;,&ouml;,&uuml;.  Such vowels can denote the vowel shift of a plural word.  Just like the English plural for man is men,  the German plural of der Mann is die  M&auml;nner.  In this instance the vowel is pronounced similarly to the letter e in the English word men.  The last additional character in German is '&szlig;',  which looks a little like a capital B and is either called eszett or 'scharfes s'. When used in words, it sounds exactly like "ss".  For example, das Fu&szlig;ballspiel is the football game in German and is pronounced the same as foosball, table soccer/football.  The eszett is the only German letter that only exists in the lower case and is replaced with SS when capitalized.  In Switzerland and Liechtenstein the ezsett has been abolished and replaced with "ss."</p> 
                    <p>Like many other languages, but not English, German has a formal and informal you; du and Sie.  In addition unlike in the United States, the formal language is expected unless you are talking to a child, a family member, a good friend or are talking to others in certain special situations.  For example,  it is common in the US to address everyone by their first name but in Germany this is reserved for friends and family. When speaking to someone from the US most people from Germany will find such premature familiarity  uncomfortable even though they might not say so.  Therefore, it is typically preferable to err on the side of caution and use the formal Sie. </p>
                    <p>Unlike in English, in German there is a penchant for creating complex compound nouns.  For example Rechtsschutzversicherungsgesellschaften, meaning insurance companies providing legal protection, is recognized by <span class="italics">The Guinness Book of World Records </span> as the longest German word in everyday use.  This can make it difficult to learn or write in German for beginners.  Even simple words like entschuldigung, the German word for sorry, can initially seem challenging both to pronounce and spell.</p> 
                    <p> Of course, these are not the only challenges that could pose difficulty for the student.  For example, many grammar rules are different in German than they are in English.</p>
