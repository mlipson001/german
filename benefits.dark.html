                <h1>Why Learn a Foreign Language?</h1> 
                <p>With the ability to use apps and websites like <a href="https://translate.google.com/" target ="_blank">Google Translate</a> it may seem as though it is not important to learn a foreign language.  In fact, Google Translate is so powerful that its app can translate text on the printed page between multiple languages in real time though a phone camera.  It is also very easy to translate a webpage into different languages on the World Wide Web.</p>
                <p>However there still are many benefits of learning a new language.  A few of them are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Multingual and Bilingual people may become smarter because it challenges them to concentrate and boosts their problem solving skills.</li>
                    <li>People who speak more than one language may delay the onset of <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2013/11/14/244813470/new-study-shows-brain-benefits-of-bilingualism" target ="_blank">dementia.</a> </li> 
                    <li>Bill Gates has a regret: not learning a <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2015/01/28/technology/bill-gates-regret/" target ="_blank">foreign language</a>.</li>
                </ul>    
                <h1>Why German?</h1> 
                <p>There are many reasons to learn German.</p>
                
                <p>English and German are both Germanic languages. Because they are so closely related, they share many features.  Many German words can be easily recognized by someone who knows English such as Land,  Finger and Winter.  In addition, words like Mutter, Vater, Bruder und Haus can be easily translated as mother,  father, brother and house when spoken. Because of their common roots and their borrowing from each other and Greek and Latin, it is estimated that 40 percent of all German words have English cognates (common etymological origins). </p>
                <p>The most obvious benefit to learning German is the ability to speak to local people in Germany.</p> 
                
                <p>Should you want to visit Germany and their castles or drive on the autobahn it may be helpful to know the language. 
                    There are approximately 92 million German speakers in the top 10 countries with German speaking people including 75 million in Germany and 2 million in the United States according to <a href="http://www.mapsofworld.com/world-top-ten/countries-with-most-german-language-speaker-map.html" target ="_blank">Maps of the World.</a></p> 
 
                <p>You might earn a <a href="http://time.com/money/137042/foreign-language-fluency-pay-salary/" target ="_blank"> higher salary</a>.  Learning a foreign language may enhance employment desirability and a study found that German has a higher than average pay benefit of a second language.</p> 
                
                <p>You or your children can opt to study abroad and get a <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2016/02/23/pf/college/free-college-europe/index.html" target ="_blank">high-quality education in Germany</a> for either a low cost or for free.  Although some classes are taught entirely in English it would still be beneficial to be able to speak in the local language when one is living abroad.</p>
 
                <p>...or perhaps you just want to put on Lederhosen or a Dirndl and go to Munich for Oktoberfest.</p>
