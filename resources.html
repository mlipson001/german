                    <h1>Resources</h1> 
                    <p>There are a lot of avenues to choose from in order to learn and practice the German language. Each has its benefits and can be used to supplement each other to enhance the learning process.</p> 
                    <h2>Books</h2> 
                    <p>One of the ways that people have tried to learn languages is through books and audiobooks.  This enables the student to learn at their own pace and on their own schedule.  The downside is that although one can reread and go over the audiobooks for reinforcement, it is not possible to ask questions or to get feedback on progress or pronunciation.  In addition, it is also possible to lose focus and never complete the courses because there is no set timetable.  The books typically come in two types of teaching styles: either story-based or learning-based.  The story-based books allow the students to read or hear stories with basic, intermediate or advanced German language levels to learn German.   The stories can either be excusively in German or add German words and passages to a story in the learner's native language to teach German to the student.  The learning-based books tend to focus on one or more areas of German in an attempt to explain the underlying framework or vocabulary necessary to speak, read or understand German.</p> 
                    <h3>A couple of examples of story based books are:</h3> 
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Learn-German-With-Stories-Beginners-ebook/dp/B00F33E3C0/ref=pd_ys_ir_kstore_12" target ="_blank">Learn German With Stories for Beginners</a></li>

                    </ul>

                    <h3>Some language programs are:</h3>

                    </ul>    
                    <h2>Videos (Vlogs), Websites, Blogs and Podcasts</h2> 
                    <p>A similar but more modern way to learn is through videos.  The learning techniques offered on video tend to be the same by books but they require a little more technologically savvy to find and use this technique.  One easy way to learn is to use youtube to find channels that help people understand the German language or German culture.</p>  

                    <p >A couple of channels of note are:</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Another way to learn German is through watching movies or TV series in German.  Video sites on the internet like YouTube and Netflix have German content.  They have German-made content and also films and tv shows that can be be changed to add German subtitles or German voiceovers. </p>
                    <div class="over">
                        <p>Deutch Friends on Youtube</p>

                    </div>
                    <p></p>

                    <p>Blogs are continually-updating content websites.  One example is at <a href="http://www.fluentu.com/german/blog/" target ="_blank">FluentU</a>.</p>  
                    <p>The <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/languages/german/" target ="_blank">BBC</a> has an archived website with a lot of content for teaching German. </p> 
                    <p>There are podcasts that will help to teach the German language and culture.  Podcasts are archived or continually updated audio recordings, usually part of a themed series that can be downloaded and consumed on many devices such as smartphones, computers and digital audio players.</p>
                    <h3>Some podcast are:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/learn-german-for-free-german/id211033454?mt=2" target ="_blank">Learn German for Free</a></li>

                    </ul>     
                    <h2>Software</h2> 
                    <p>An effective way to learn a new language is via a software package.  Like the previously discussed methods, software packages allow the student to learn at their own pace and on their own schedule.  However software, when used with the appropriate hardware, can track the student's progress and provide relevant feedback.</p> 
                    <p>One of the most well-known language software packages is <a href="http://www.rosettastone.com/" target ="_blank">Rosetta Stone.</a></p> 

                    <p>It  is a full-featured software package for learning a new language.  It teaches by "dynamic immersion" which is designed to be similar to the way children are taught their native language.  Rosetta Stone believes in fully immersing the student in the language without using any of the student's native language to explain the lessons.  Easy words and phrases are used with high repetition in the beginning of the program to get the student comfortable with the vocabulary.  It uses image matching, speech if available on the device and text entry to assist the student with pronunciation and comprehension. </p>
                    <p>Another software package is <a href="http://www.fluenz.com/languages/learn-german/" target ="_blank">Fluenz.</a></p> 

                    <p>Fluenz tries to teach the student by relating the grammar and syntax of a foreign language to the structure of the language they already know. The course begins with structures and key vocabulary so that the student can build useful German sentences.  The course builds on the foundation that it set during the remainder of the sessions to expand the student's range of communication while adding an important level of depth to their interactions.</p>  
                    <p><a href="https://www.duolingo.com/" target ="_blank">Duolingo</a> is another widely available language software package.</p> 

                    <p>Duolingo teaches in a similar immersion style as Rosetta Stone.  It is free and available via the web or mobile app.  It is a compelling platform for learning or strengthening one's skills in several languages.</p>  
                    <h1>Immersion learning</h1> 
                    <p>One of the best ways to become fluent in a language is to go to a country where  it is the dominant or official language.  Because German is among the most widely spoken languages in the European Union the easiest place for German immersion learning is in the European Union. It is the official language in Germany, Austria and Liechtenstein and is one of the official languages of Belgium, Switzerland and Luxembourg.  In addition German, or a German dialect, is the co-official language in several regions in Italy, Poland and Brazil.  Typical ways to accomplish this would be a study abroad program, an extended vacation in a foreign coutry or a short term transfer to an office in a different country through employment. </p>
                    <h2>Immersion training classes</h2> 
                    <p>Immersion training classes attempt to duplicate an immersion language opportunity in a classroom setting.  Probably the best known language training institute is <a href="http://www.berlitz.us/" target ="_blank">Berlitz.</a>  However, there are also a number of other institutes and schools like <a href="http://www.abclang.com/german.html" target ="_blank">ABClang</a>.</p> 

                    <p>In Germany, the <a href="https://www.goethe.de/ins/de/en/kur.html" target ="_blank">Goethe Institut</a> has German language courses that are geared towards the student's language goals and abilities including special courses for professionals or for children. </p>

                    <h2>Language Exchange sites</h2>  
                    <p>If one cannot do immersion learning in a foreign country and does not want to attend training classes, they can still participate in immersion learning in a language exchange site where students interact with native speakers of other languages.</p> 
                    <p>One such site is <a href="https://www.interpals.net/app/langex" target ="_blank">interpals</a>.</p> 
                    <h2>Paid Language Partner Sites</h2> 
                    <p>Hiring a professional tutor can be an effective way to learn a new language.  The experience of the sessions are personalized, the schedule is flexible and cost is on a per lesson basis.  One way to find a tutor is through a language partner site like <a href="https://www.italki.com/home" target ="_blank">italki.com</a>.  There a person can get the discipline of a training program with a language partner who has teaching experience from any location. </p>
                    <h2>Online courses</h2> 
                    <h3>There are a number of online courses that teach German including <a href="http://mangolanguages.com/" target ="_blank">Mango Languages</a></h3> 

                    <p>One can learn a new language with this interactive database that provides step by step lesson plans for 71 different languages including German. The database is available through many avenues including <a href="http://www.nypl.org/collections/articles-databases/mango-languages">the New York Public Library. </a></p>

                    <h3>Another online source of language classes is Udemy</h3>
